# 🚗 Smart Booking System - Car Availability

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Automatic Car Hiding**
When a car is booked, it automatically **disappears** from the available listings and will **reappear** once the booking period ends.

---

## 📋 Features

### 1. **Available Cars Only**
- ✅ Home page shows only available cars (first 6)
- ✅ Cars page shows only available cars
- ✅ Filtered by category (only available cars in each category)
- ✅ Booked cars are hidden from all listings

### 2. **Car Detail Page**
- ✅ Shows availability status badge:
  - **Green Badge**: "Available for Booking" ✓
  - **Red Badge**: "Currently Booked" ✗
- ✅ Booking button is disabled if car is unavailable
- ✅ Clear message when car is currently booked

### 3. **Booking Conflict Prevention**
- ✅ System checks for date conflicts before accepting bookings
- ✅ Prevents double-booking the same car
- ✅ Shows error if dates overlap with existing booking
- ✅ Real-time availability checking

## 🔄 How Availability Works

### **When is a Car "Booked"?**
A car is considered booked when:
- There's a confirmed booking (status = 'confirmed')
- Today's date falls within the booking period (pickup to return date)
- The booking hasn't been cancelled

### **When is a Car "Available"?**
A car becomes available again when:
- No active bookings exist for that car
- The return date of all bookings has passed
- All bookings were cancelled

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Booking
```
Today: January 1
User A books Car #1: January 2 - January 5

Result:
- Car #1 disappears from listings on January 2
- Car #1 reappears on January 6 (after return date)
```

### Scenario 2: Booking Conflict
```
Existing: Car #1 booked January 5-10
User B tries to book: January 7-12

Result:
- System rejects booking (dates overlap)
- Error message: "Car is not available for the selected dates"
- User B must choose different dates
```

### Scenario 3: Same Car, Different Dates
```
Existing: Car #1 booked January 5-10
User B tries to book: January 11-15

Result:
- Booking succeeds (no overlap)
- Car #1 will be unavailable January 5-15
```

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### **Availability Check Logic**
```python
def is_car_available(car_id):
    today = datetime.now().date()
    
    for booking in bookings:
        if booking['car_id'] == car_id and booking['status'] == 'confirmed':
            pickup = datetime.strptime(booking['pickup_date'], '%Y-%m-%d').date()
            return_date = datetime.strptime(booking['return_date'], '%Y-%m-%d').date()
            
            # Car is booked if today is within booking period
            if pickup <= today <= return_date:
                return False
    
    return True
```

### **Conflict Detection**
```python
# Check if new booking dates overlap with existing bookings
if not (return_date < booking_pickup or pickup > booking_return):
    # Dates overlap - reject booking
```

## 🔐 Admin View vs Customer View

### **Customer View**
- Only sees available cars
- Cannot see booked cars in listings
- Can attempt to book any visible car

### **Admin View**
- Sees ALL cars in admin dashboard
- Can edit/delete any car (booked or not)
- Can add new cars anytime
- Dashboard shows all inventory regardless of booking status

---

## 📱 User Experience

### **For Customers:**
1. Browse cars - Only available vehicles shown
2. Select a car
3. See green "Available" badge
4. Choose dates
5. If dates conflict → Error message shown
6. If dates OK → Booking confirmed
7. Car disappears from listings during booking period

### **Error Messages:**
- ❌ "Car is not available for the selected dates. Please choose different dates."
- ❌ "Return date must be after pickup date"
- ❌ "Invalid date format"

---

## 🎁 Additional Benefits

1. **No Double Booking**: System prevents conflicts automatically
2. **Real-time Updates**: Availability updates immediately after booking
3. **Clear Communication**: Visual badges show status at a glance
4. **User-Friendly**: Customers only see what's available
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Cars auto-return to listings after booking ends

---

## 📝 Notes

- Availability is checked based on **today's date**
- Cars with cancelled bookings become available immediately
- System works in-memory (resets on server restart)
- For production, implement database with proper date/time handling
- Consider timezone management for international bookings
